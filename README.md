Goal: Action classification from a video by different topologies

Dataset:  UCF101 dataset and own filmed videos

Topologies: 
- CNN by RGB input features
- CNN by Optical Flow features
- CNN by Multiple Optical Flow features
- Two-Stream CNN by RGB and Multiple Optical Flow features

Techniques:
- Cross-Validation
- Parameter tuning (Batch size, Learning rate, Dropout ratio, and Training Usage ratio)
- Data augmentation (Reduced resolution, Rotation, Mirroring, Cropping)
